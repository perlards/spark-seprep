Hi, my name is Amy Kouch. My favorite coding language is java because it is
very systematic and easier to comprehend than others for me.

## Example code
''' package main
import("fmt";"math/rand";"time")
func main(){
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    jokes := []string{"There are 10 types of people in the world: those who und$
    fmt.Println(jokes[rand.Intn(len(jokes))])
}
'''
